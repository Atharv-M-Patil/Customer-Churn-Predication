# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on historical behavior and service usage.  
The model is built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn/Matplotlib, and TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction helps companies identify customers who are likely to stop using the service.  
By predicting churn early, companies can take action to retain customers.

This project includes:

- Data cleaning  
- Feature engineering  
- Data visualization  
- Machine learning and deep learning model training  
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and metrics  
- Final prediction

Key columns:

- Gender  
- SeniorCitizen  
- Partner  
- Dependents  
- Tenure  
- Phone & Internet services  
- Contract type  
- Payment method  
- Monthly & total charges  
- Churn (target variable)

## 🔧 Data Processing Steps (Pipeline)

1. Load dataset  
2. Handle missing or incorrect values  
3. Convert `"TotalCharges"` to numeric  
4. Remove irrelevant columns (`customerID`)  
5. Replace service-related categorical values  
6. Encode categorical columns  
7. Scale numerical features  
8. Train-test split  
9. Model training  
10. Model evaluation

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The final model was built using **TensorFlow/Keras (Artificial Neural Network)**.  
- Dataset was split into train and test sets.  
- The ANN was trained to predict whether a customer will churn.  

**Model Output:**  
- 1 → Customer will churn  
- 0 → Customer will not churn

## 📈 Final Outcome

- The model predicts **non-churn customers (Class 0)** very accurately.  
- Moderate performance for **churn customers (Class 1)** due to class imbalance.  
- Accuracy of **78%** demonstrates reliable churn predictions.  

**Business Impact:**  
- Reduce customer loss  
- Improve retention strategies  
- Understand key churn factors
